USB Rubber Ducky
a few years ago, some script kiddies started selling a keystroke injection took called the usb rubber ducky. it looks like a normal usb storage, but registered in the victims machine has a HID (Human Indentification Device, like a keyboard or mouse) and immediatly dumps a custom payload at 1000 WPM. This payload can be anything from endless chrome tabs of "never gonna give you up" to a powewrshell script that copies all passwords on your machine, and mails it in csv form to your own email. cool!



Hardware/Software
raspberry pi pico
micro usb to usb cable
circuit python

Problems (aka: what the fuck is HID)
